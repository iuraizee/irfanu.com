# Portfolio

This is my personal [portfolio website](https://irfanu.com/) built using React and Next.js with content managed via Google Docs (using ArchieML) and Google Sheets. This site is deployed using Cloudflare Pages.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (>= 18)
* npm

## Running locally

`npm run dev`

The site will be available locally at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

Updates to the `main` branch automatically trigger Cloudfare Pages to rebuild and deploy. Easy peasy.
